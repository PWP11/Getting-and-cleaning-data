# Getting-and-cleaning-data
###Coursera Getting and Cleaning Data Assignment

This repo contains the following files submitted for the above assignment:

1) a tidy data set as described below, averages.txt

2) the script for performing the analysis, run_analysis.R

3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work performed to clean up the data, CodeBook.md

4) this README.md which explains how the scripts work and how they are connected.

The code run_analysis.R reads in the source data and performs the transformations required to

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set.

2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.

5. From the data set in step 4, create a second, independent tidy data set (called "average") with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The data set "average" is exported as a text file "averages.txt".

The variables, the data and the transformations performed are described in the CodeBook.md.
